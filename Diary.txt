Started tutorial for the resume/portfolio site - Brad Traversy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzHS-n2gqU&list=PLillGF-RfqbYoGoCjKoMOkVznV6aSXKzU&index=1

The beginning of the video shows how to set up scss/sass and use it
to update the css file

To start the project you need two terminal windows:
1st window: 
npm run sass
2nd window:
open Live Server

Just remember to update the main.sass file, not the dist/css/main.css file
